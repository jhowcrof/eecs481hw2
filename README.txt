My application is a simple Tic Tac Toe game for the Windows desktop.

To get the code:
git clone https://github.com/jhowcrof/eecs481hw2.git
The repo is public. 

To build the app:
Open the .sln file in Visual Studio.  Build the project, then run it.

To play the game:
There are 2 players: Red and Blue.  Red is Player 1, Blue is Player 2.
When you start the game, Red goes first, then Blue, and it alternates until
someone wins or there are no blank squares.  Then it resets.
